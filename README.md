## Description

The Employee Directory is a React based application. Making a call to the Random User API (resource below), I used an NPM package to display the results in a table format. A user is able to search listed employees by first name or sort by last name/email. This application helped me further understand components, component sate, and user events.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- React-data-table-component (NPM package)
